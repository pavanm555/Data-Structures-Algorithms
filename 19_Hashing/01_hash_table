-> Support Insertion, Deletion, Search in average case O(1) time
-> Unordered Data Structure

Key Components
-> Hash function
-> Hash table
-> Collision handling scheme


Good Hash Function 
-> Reduces the chance of collision - Distribute keys uniformly over the table
-> Should be fast to compute

-> h(key) = key % table size
-> Better if table size is a prime number
